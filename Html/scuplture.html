            <p>
                The ur sculpture of art history, this tiny figurine measuring just over four inches in height was

                fertility goddess to masturbation aid.

            <h3>Rachel Harrison, Alexander the Great, 2007</h3>
            <p>Rachel Harrison’s work combines a consummate formalism with a knack for imbuing seemingly abstract
                elements with multiple meanings, including political ones. She fiercely questions monumentality and the
                masculine prerogative that goes with it</p>
