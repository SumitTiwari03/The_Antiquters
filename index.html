        True <b>coinage</b> began soon after 650 BC. The 6th-century Greek poet Xenophanes, quoted by the historian
        Herodotus,
        ascribed its invention to the Lydians, “the first to strike and use coins of gold and silver.” King Croesus of
        Lydia (reigned c. 560–546 BC) produced a bimetallic system of pure gold and pure silver coins, but the
        foundation
        deposit of the Artemisium (temple to Artemis) at Ephesus shows that electrum coins were in production before
        Croesus, possibly under King Gyges. Croesus’ earliest coins were of electrum, which the Greeks called “white
        gold."

        Painting emerged in prehistory, when nomadic people made use of paintings on rocky walls. They made drawings
        with
        charcoal leaving marks in the caves where they passed. Recent discovery made in Spain found that the oldest
        paintings discovered to date, made by humans, were made more than 42,000 years ago. The first painting was made
        by
        primitive men, believed to have been made by Homo Neanderthalis in the prehistoric era.

        Bronze replaced stone in weapons.[10] During the Bronze Age maces were in high demand. The Sumerians were the
        first people on record to have used bronze weapons. Native Americans mostly used flint spears and knives but
        used
        bronze for ceremonies and intricate decorations. Ancient artisans soon discovered the drawbacks of bronze for
        producing armaments, as while weapons made of bronze could be sharpened easily, they were not able to hold their
        edge

        Sculpture has been used as a form of human expression since prehistoric times. The earliest known works of
        sculpture date from around 32,000 B.C. Early man created utilitarian objects that were decorated with sculptural
        forms. Ancient peoples also created small animal and human figures carved in bone, ivory, or stone for possible
        spiritual or religious purposes.
